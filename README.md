# Timer.js

Timer.js is a small personal project. I wanted a simple and easy to use timer and created this responsive, fullscreen timer with keyboard and touch support.

## License
Timer.js is licensed under [WTFPL](http://www.wtfpl.net/) which pretty much means you can do what you want with this. As the license says: "Do what the fuck you want".

## How to use
It's all there in the index.html. I use [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) to concatenate and minify the source, but of course you can use Timer.js without Grunt.

### Config
Besides changing the css you can change the behavior by passing options in to the "app" in kickit.js.

## Todo
* Add support for sounds.
* Add shake support for mobile devices
